About
-----

PDF works are works where the primary fileset(s) are PDFs.  PDFs should minimally display something that allows the item
to be opened in a new tab or with the PDF.js viewer.

A PDF may also be converted on demand into a set of images making up each canvas. After that, the work will be displayed
in a IIIF viewer on the work page.

The PDF work's main file is both a :code:`pcdmuse:PreservationFile` and a :code:`pcdmuse:IntermediateFile`s. The work
may have a curated thumbnail or a thumbnail represented by the work type.

All filesets may have restrictions that prohibit view / access.
